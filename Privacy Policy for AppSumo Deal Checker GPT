This Privacy Policy explains how AppSumo Deal Checker GPT (“the GPT”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles user data.

1. No Data Storage
We do not store, sell, or share your personal data. All inputs you provide to this GPT are processed in real time by OpenAI’s systems. We do not maintain independent databases of your conversations.

2. Use of External Services
If you choose to connect to external services (e.g., paste content from AppSumo, vendor websites, or forums), that data is only used to generate the analysis you requested. No data is retained.

3. Third-Party APIs (Future Actions)
If you enable Actions that call third-party APIs (e.g., Apify for scraping), requests will be sent to those providers. Those services may collect metadata such as your IP address. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any third-party service used.

4. Security
We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information. Please do not share passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identifiers.

5. User Control
You can end a session at any time. Once you close the session, your conversation history is managed by OpenAI under its policies.

6. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy as features evolve. The latest version will always be available at this URL.
